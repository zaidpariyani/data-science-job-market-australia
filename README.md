📊 Australian Data Science Job Market Insights (2025)

As part of building my analytics portfolio, I explored the current data science job landscape in Australia using real-world job listing data.  
The goal was to uncover key trends in in-demand skills, salary ranges, and location-based demand — and present it all through a clear and interactive Power BI dashboard.


🚀 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI – for data cleaning (Power Query), modeling, and visualization
- Excel – initial review and exploration of raw data
- GitHub – version control and public portfolio hosting


 📁 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from publicly available job platforms and repositories.  
It includes:
- Job titles, company names, and locations
- Estimated salary ranges (base, high, low, average)
- 20+ technical skill flags (e.g., Python, SQL, Tableau, AWS, etc.)


📈 Key Dashboards & Visuals
- ✅ Top 15 In-Demand Skills across data jobs
- 📍 Job Demand by City(Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, etc.)
- 💰 Average Base Salary Trends
- 📊Skill-wise Salary Distribution


🧠 Key Learnings
- Learned how to unpivot wide skill columns to make them visualizable in Power BI
- Improved my skills in data transformation, DAX, and building multi-page dashboards
- Gained real insights into what employers are currently looking for in data professionals


 ✅ Outcome
This project helped me strengthen both my technical reporting and data storytelling skills, while giving me a clearer picture of the Australian data science job market.
